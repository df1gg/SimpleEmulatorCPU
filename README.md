# SimpleEmulatorCPU

Welcome to VirtualCPU Emulator! 🎮
This is a C++ project where I'm building a virtual CPU that simulates basic processor operations and instruction execution. The project is still in development, so new features and improvements are coming soon! 🛠️

I'm creating this emulator for fun and as a personal challenge to dive deeper into low-level programming. It's a passion project, so feel free to follow along as it grows! 🚀

Stay tuned for updates! <3
